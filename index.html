        <li>Walking Distance: 7.6 miles round trip</li>
        <li>Difficulty Level: Beginner</li>
        <li>Description: The Diablo Lake Trail is an excellent choice year-round, but it's a particularly good option for an early season hike in the stunning North Cascades National Park, much of which is inaccessible during the winter and spring.</li>
        <li>Comments: You don't want to miss the trek down to the bridge.</li>
        <li>Features: Park pass not required</li>
        <li>Proximity: 34 miles from 98002</li>
